<h1>Best Movies According to Arunim</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies </h2>

<h3>INTERSTELLAR </h3>
<P><H4>I like Interstellar, because it focuses mainly on personal loss and the love one feels for their family. The beginning is spectacular! I love how it opens with a farm surrounded by crops of corn, a humble beginning. Its much better than starting the movie with all that intense, apocalyptic action we see at the beginning and end of superhero movies.

<H3>INCEPTION</H3>
<P><H4>At its core, Inception is a heist movie, but it's far from your typical caper. Dom Cobb, played with emotional depth by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a skilled thief who specializes in infiltrating the dreams of his targets to steal their deepest secrets. However, the film takes an exhilarating twist when Cobb is given the seemingly impossible task of planting an idea into someone's mind â€“ the process known as inception. As he assembles a team of experts, each with their own unique skill set, the intricate layers of the plot are woven together, and the audience is drawn into a world where reality and dreams blur.</H4></P>
<H3>TITANIC</H3>
<H4><P>I find this movie one of my childhood favourites I was only 7 to 8 yrs old when it came out used to watch it loads on video back when modern technology Youtube did not exist. On 100th anniversary mum and I watched it in 3d and recently watched it again together for 25th year since it was released it even went on my own to see it again as its just so epic I just feel like I could watch it over 100 times.
